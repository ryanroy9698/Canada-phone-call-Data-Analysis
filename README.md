## Overview

This project aims to analyze phone call data to identify patterns and insights related to call frequency, duration, and locations. The analysis includes calculating descriptive statistics, identifying frequent contacts, and examining call patterns over time.

## Data Preparation

The dataset is loaded from an Excel file, and basic preprocessing steps are performed, including checking for null values and duplicates.

## Descriptive Statistics

Key statistics about the dataset are calculated, such as the total number of calls, and the breakdown of incoming and outgoing calls.

## Call Frequency Analysis

### Most and Least Frequent Outgoing Numbers

- **Top 3 Numbers with the Most Counts of Outgoing Calls:** Identifies the top three numbers that were called the most frequently.
- **Numbers with the Least Counts of Outgoing Calls:** Identifies numbers that were called the least frequently.

### Highest and Lowest Total Duration of Outgoing Calls

- **Top 3 Numbers with the Highest Duration of Outgoing Calls:** Lists the top three numbers that had the longest call durations.
- **Numbers with the Lowest Duration of Outgoing Calls:** Lists numbers with the shortest call durations.

### Location of Outgoing Calls

Analyzes the geographic locations of the outgoing calls and identifies patterns based on the 'To city' field.

## Monthly Call Patterns

Examines the calling patterns on a monthly basis, including the total duration of incoming and outgoing calls for each month.

## Observations

Summarizes key findings from the analysis, such as unusual calling patterns, changes in behavior over time, consistent interaction patterns, and potential context shifts.

## Plots and Visualizations

Provides visualizations to support the analysis, such as bar charts and line plots to illustrate call frequency, duration, and monthly patterns.
